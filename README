This file was created by PyCharm 1.5.4 for binding GitHub repository

Work in progress...

Takes a BF3 Procon log file, processes it, and uploads the event data to an SQL database.

Requires a config.py with:
  MYSQL_IP - server ip
  MYSQL_USER - your mysql user
  MYSQL_PASS - your mysql password

Of course it won't work without proper tables setup, but I don't have documentation for that written yet.
If you're interested in using my system with yours, plaese contact me.
